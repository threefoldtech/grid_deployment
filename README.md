# Threefold grid deployment

This repo will facilitate automation in deploying identical Threefold Grid backend stacks.  

The project is still under development.

## Snapshots

Snapshots are created on a daily basis, [find them and scripts here](https://github.com/threefoldtech/grid_deployment/tree/development/grid-snapshots).

## Docker-compose

To keep deploying as simple as possible, a set of bash and docker-compose scripts will be created.

Documentation for this still has to be completed.
