# Threefold Grid backend

This repo provides all tools required to setup your own Grid backend instance (aka a 'Grid stack'). Such a stack will be completely standalone and provide you with all available grid functionality.  


## Grid snapshots

Daily snapshots can be found here: https://bknd.snapshot.grid.tf/

Have a look at the docs to setup your own snapshot creation or use `RSYNC` to download the snapshots.


## Docker Compose

To keep deploying as simple as possible we provide a set of bash and Docker Compose scripts for each network (Devnet, QAnet, Testnet & Mainnet).

Have a look at the documentation on how to get started.
