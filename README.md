# Threefold Grid backend

This repo provides all tools required to setup your own Grid backend instance (aka a 'Grid stack'). Such a stack will be completely standalone and provide you with all available grid functionality.  


## Grid snapshots

Daily snapshots can be found here: https://bknd.snapshot.grid.tf/

Snapshots are created on a daily basis, [find them and scripts here](https://github.com/threefoldtech/grid_deployment/tree/development/grid-snapshots) .


## Docker Compose

To keep deploying as simple as possible we provide a set of bash and Docker Compose scripts for each network (Devnet, QAnet, Testnet & Mainnet). Have a look at the documentation on how to get started.
